          <h2>Tea</h2>
          <p>
            Regarded for thousands of years in the East as a key to good
            health&sbquo; happiness&sbquo; and wisdom&sbquo; tea has caught the
            attention of researchers in the West&sbquo; who are discovering the
            many health
            <strong>benefits</strong> of different types of teas&#46;
          </p>
          <p class="teaBenefits">
            Studies have found that some teas may help with
            <span>cancer</span>&sbquo; <span>heart disease</span>&sbquo; and
            <span>diabetes</span>&#59; encourage <span>weight loss</span>&#59;
            <span>lower cholesterol</span>&#59; and bring about
            <span>mental alertness</span>&#46; Tea also appears to have
            <span>antimicrobial</span> qualities&#46;
          </p>
          <p>
            <q>There doesn&#39;t seem to be a downside to tea&sbquo;</q> &#8212;
            says American Dietetic Association spokeswoman Katherine
            Tallmadge&sbquo; MA&sbquo; RD&sbquo; LD&#46;
            <q
              >I think it&#39;s a great <em>alternative</em> to coffee drinking.
              First&sbquo; tea has <em>less caffeine</em>&#46; It&#39;s pretty
              well established that the compounds in tea &#8212; their
              flavonoids &#8212; are good for the heart and may reduce
              cancer&#46;</q

          <p>
            Although a lot of questions remain about how long tea needs to be
            steeped for the most benefit&sbquo; and how much you need to
            drink&sbquo; nutritionists agree any tea is good tea&#46;
            Still&sbquo; they prefer brewed teas over bottled to avoid the extra
            calories and sweeteners&#46;

        <h2>Ten benefits of drinking tea</h2>
        <h4>Enjoying your daily cuppa?</h4>
        <p>
          No matter what the day or the season&sbquo; tea is a refreshing drink
          and can be served hot or iced&#46; At the very least&sbquo; it&#39;s a
          flavourful way of getting enough fluid into your body each day and
          studies have shown teas can help protect your teeth and your
          heart&sbquo; as well as possibly even helping to stave off cancer&#46;
          There is plenty of research showing that drinking tea can improve your
          health&#46; Here are ten health benefits of tea&#46;
        </p>
        <h4>Tea contains antioxidants</h4>
        <p>
          Antioxidants work to prevent the body&#39;s version of rust and thus
          help to keep us young and protect us from damage from pollution&#46;
        </p>
        <h4>Tea contains less caffeine than coffee</h4>
        <p>
          Herbal tea blends have no caffeine and traditional teas have less than
          50 percent of what typically is found in coffee&#46; This means you
          can drink it without as many effects on your nervous system according
          to nutritionists&#46;
        </p>
        <img src="pictures/Home Page/7.jpeg" alt="glass mug" />
        <h4>Tea may reduce your risk of heart attack and stroke</h4>
        <p>
          A recent study found a nearly 20 percent reduction in the risk of
          heart attack and a 35 percent reduced risk of stroke among those who
          drank one to three cups of green tea a day&#58; Those who drank four
          or more cups of green tea daily had a 32 percent reduction in the risk
          of having a heart attack and lower levels of the bad cholesterol&#44;
          LDL&#46;
        </p>

        <h4>Tea may help with weight loss</h4>
        <p>
          Although research on this isn&#39;t as strong, studies have shown an
          effect have depended on consumption of large amounts of tea&#44; often
          in pill form&#46;
        </p>
        <h4>Tea may help protect your bones</h4>
        <p>
          Data from recent animal studies has shown that green tea may prevent
          bone loss&#46;
        </p>
        <h4>Tea may keep your smile bright</h4>
        <p>
          Japanese researchers have found that tea can decrease tooth loss
          because it changes the pH in your mouth when you drink it and that may
          be what prevents cavities&#46; Tea does not appear to erode tooth
          enamel&#46;
        </p>
        <img src="pictures/Home Page/8.jpeg" alt="" />
        <h4>Tea may boost the immune system</h4>
        <p>
          Studies have shown tea can tune up immune cells so they reach their
          targets quicker&#46;
        </p>
        <h4>Tea may help battle cancer</h4>
        <p>
          Studies on this are currently mixed and research is ongoing&#46;
          However&#44; if you&#39;ve got a strong family history of cancer and
          you want to do anything you can&#44; increasing your tea consumption
          might help&#46;
        </p>
        <h4>Herbal tea may soothe the digestive system</h4>
        <p>
          Herbal teas such as chamomile can be good for people with irritable
          bowel syndrome because it is an antispasmodic&#46; Other herbal teas
          such as ginger can help calm nausea&#46;
        </p>
        <h4>Pure tea is calorie free</h4>
        <p>
          Tea is a great no&#8209;calorie alternative to water&#46; It provides
          so many options for flavour and taste&#44; can be drunk hot or cold
          and you don&#39;t have to put anything in it&#46; So&#44; enjoy that
          cup of tea this afternoon and it is recommended that you should drink
          four cups of tea a day to be of optimal benefit to your health&#46;
